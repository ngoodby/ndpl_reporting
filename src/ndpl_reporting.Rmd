## __Bat Activity__

The following bar chart gives a sense of when bats were active at these sites this past summer, as it shows the number of bat recordings captured during each hour of the day. Note that this is a total count that includes all survey nights at all survey sites in this report.  

```{r Bat Activity Bar Chart}

## __Background__

Our region’s bats face unprecedented threats, including widespread habitat alteration and destruction, climate change and drought, and the arrival and spread of a deadly fungal disease called White-nose Syndrome. Yet little is known about the current abundance and distribution of most US bat species. NABat brings together a diverse and extensive network of partners in collecting data to assess the status and trends of bat populations throughout North America to inform the conservation and management of bats. Participation by private landowners is critical to the success of effective bat population monitoring in our region as many of our highest priority survey locations occur on private land. 

There are over 1,400 bat species in the world, with California and Nevada being home to 25. Our region’s bats play important ecological roles that are vital to the health of our natural ecosystems and our human economies. Scientists estimate that insect-eating bats may save U.S. farmers roughly $23 billion each year by reducing crop damage and limiting the need for pesticides, as they eat up to half of their body weight in insects each night.

Bats are difficult to observe and identify because they are most active at night and roost in small spaces. However, using “bat acoustic detectors”, we can record the echolocation calls of bats as they travel and forage for food during the night. The recordings can then be used to identify the species of the bats present in an area. 

***

## __Methods__

NABat divides North America into a grid of 10 x 10 km squares and randomly assigns a priority ranking to every square, which is used to determine which areas to target for surveying. Exact survey locations within the 10 x 10 km squares are then selected by biologists to target areas with high expected bat activity. Bat acoustic detectors are placed near landscape features that may attract bats, such as water, dead trees, barns, open space, and forest edges. 

The detectors are deployed to record for four consecutive nights. Once collected, the recorded echolocation calls are identified to the species level using auto-identification software and suspected species are then confirmed through expert review by Bat Conservation International staff. Data are then contributed to the NABat database and used to estimate habitat occupancy and population trends to guide wildlife management efforts.

Below is an example sonogram that shows a string of bat pulses. A sonogram is a graph of the frequency of sound emitted over time. Bats typically emit calls at very high frequencies. So high, that in many cases, their calls can't be heard by the human ear. Looking at the sonograms of bat echolocation sequences allows us to "hear" with our eyes. Below is the echolocation sequence of a hoary bat (*Lasiurus cinereus*). You can see each echolocation pulse made by the bat as a colored streak on the sonogram.
